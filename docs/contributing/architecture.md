# Architecture

## Overview

The .NET Profiling API is accessible via COM interop (cross-platform thanks to the Platform Adaptation Layer) and allows little overhead profiling compared to other methods while giving a wide range of possibilities for profiling purpose. Perfview uses this API (on top of ETW) however it does it from managed code calling mocked COM objects written in C#.     

In this Dr-Dotnet, we're using **Rust** for coding the profilers for the safety and the modernity of the language. The CLR profiling API rust binding are originally taken from [this project from Camden Reslink](https://github.com/camdenreslink/clr-profiler) who did a really great job.    
The UI and profilers management are coded in C#, for the productivity the language offers and because it is convenient for interoperability with Rust. Bindings between C# and Rust are autogenerated using [FFIDJI](https://github.com/ogxd/ffidji) (but they are fairly trivial for now, to be honest, this is probably overkill).

Here is a diagram of the profiling workflow:

participant user as End User
participant drdotnet as Dr-Dotnet UI (Web or Desktop)
participant app as Your Dotnet Application(s)
participant profilers as Profilers Library

user->>+drdotnet: List dotnet processes
drdotnet->>+app: Request process(es) PID(s)
app-->>-drdotnet: PID(s)
drdotnet-->>-user: Display list of processes

user->>+drdotnet: List profilers
drdotnet->>+profilers: Request available profilers through interop (Csharp to Rust)
profilers-->>-drdotnet: List of profilers
drdotnet-->>-user: Display list of profilers

user->>+drdotnet: Run given profiler on given process
drdotnet->>profilers: Copy library in folder that is accessible by targeted process
drdotnet->>+app: Request CLR to attach profilers from library
app->>-profilers: Load, instantiate and initialize profiler
activate profilers
opt Actual profiler implementation
app->>profilers: Some callback
app->>profilers: Some callback
app->>profilers: Some callback
end
profilers-->>-app: Request detach
app->>+profilers: Detached callback
profilers->>profilers: Create session files
profilers-->>-drdotnet: Session files are available
drdotnet-->>-user: Display profiling session results
```

The following sections will cover some part of that workflow more in depth.

## C# / Rust Interoperability

The interoperability between the C# app and the Rust profilers is done with autogenerated bindings thanks to [FFIDJI](https://github.com/ogxd/ffidji).
The file `src/DrDotnet.Interop/Interop.xml` describes the Rust methods that the C# app can call, along with all its associated types.    
Based on this definition, FFIDJI will generate `Interop.cs` and `Interop.rs`.

### How to make changes to bindings?
- If you are on Windows, the FFIDJI executable is included at `src/DrDotnet.Interop/ffidji.exe`.  
Otherwise, you must clone https://github.com/ogxd/ffidji and build it.
- Run `ffidji -f csharp Interop.cs -t rust interop.rs -i Interop.xml`
- Copy `interop.rs` to `src/DrDotnet.Profilers/` (and replace).  
Code generation will only generate types and method signatures, so the rust method implementations must be done manually.  
The C# one is automatically updated so there is nothing to do on this side.

  | WARNING: Remember that this interoperability loads the profilers library in the DrDotnet process, not in the profiled process, so you cannot set variables in memory to use them during the profiling session |
